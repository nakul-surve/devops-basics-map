# DevOps Basics Map

This repository explains how core DevOps tools and concepts connect with each other.

## Linux
- Foundation of servers
- Used for application hosting and system management

## Git
- Version control for code and configuration
- Enables collaboration and change tracking

## Docker
- Packages applications into containers
- Ensures consistency across environments

## AWS
- Provides cloud infrastructure
- Hosts servers, networking, and services

## How They Work Together
- Code is written and tracked using Git
- Applications run on Linux servers
- Docker packages applications
- AWS provides scalable infrastructure

## Learning Goal
Build a strong DevOps foundation by understanding connections, not just tools.
